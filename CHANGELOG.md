# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenHarness should be recorded in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project currently tracks changes in a lightweight, repository-oriented way.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Docker as an alternative sandbox backend (`sandbox.backend = "docker"`) for stronger execution isolation with configurable resource limits, network isolation, and automatic image management.
- Built-in `gemini` provider profile so `oh setup` offers Google Gemini as a first-class provider choice, with `gemini_api_key` auth source and `gemini-2.5-flash` as the default model.
- `diagnose` skill: trace agent run failures and regressions using structured evidence from run artifacts.
- OpenAI-compatible API client (`--api-format openai`) supporting any provider that implements the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format, including Alibaba DashScope, DeepSeek, GitHub Models, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and more.
- `OPENHARNESS_API_FORMAT` environment variable for selecting the API format.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback when using OpenAI-format providers.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for Python linting, tests, and frontend TypeScript checks.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with local setup, validation commands, and PR expectations.
- `docs/SHOWCASE.md` with concrete OpenHarness usage patterns and demo commands.
- GitHub issue templates and a pull request template.
- React TUI assistant messages now render structured Markdown blocks, including headings, lists, code fences, blockquotes, links, and tables.

### Fixed

- React TUI spinner now stays visible throughout the entire agent turn: `assistant_complete` no longer resets `busy` state prematurely, and `tool_started` explicitly sets `busy=true` so the status bar remains active even when tool calls follow an assistant message. `line_complete` is the sole signal that ends the turn and clears the spinner.
- Skill loader now uses `yaml.safe_load` to parse SKILL.md frontmatter, correctly handling YAML block scalars (`>`, `|`), quoted values, and other standard YAML constructs instead of naive line-by-line splitting.
- `BackendHostConfig` was missing the `cwd` field, causing `AttributeError: 'BackendHostConfig' object has no attribute 'cwd'` on startup when `oh` was run after the runtime refactor that added `cwd` support to `build_runtime`.
- Shell-escape `$ARGUMENTS` substitution in command hooks to prevent shell injection from payload values containing metacharacters like `$(...)` or backticks.
- Swarm `_READ_ONLY_TOOLS` now uses actual registered tool names (snake_case) instead of PascalCase, fixing read-only auto-approval in `handle_permission_request`.
- Memory scanner now parses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`) instead of returning raw `---` as description.
- Memory search matches against body content in addition to metadata, with metadata weighted higher for relevance.
- Memory search tokenizer handles Han characters for multilingual queries.
- Fixed duplicate response in React TUI caused by double Enter key submission in the input handler.
- Fixed concurrent permission modals overwriting each other in TUI default mode when the LLM returns multiple tool calls in one response; `_ask_permission` now serialises callers via an `asyncio.Lock` so each modal is shown and resolved before the next one is emitted.
- Fixed React TUI Markdown tables to size columns from rendered cell text so inline formatting like code spans and bold text no longer breaks alignment.
- Fixed grep tool crashing with `ValueError` / `LimitOverrunError` when ripgrep outputs a line longer than 64 KB (e.g. minified assets or lock files). The asyncio subprocess stream limit is now 8 MB and oversized lines are skipped rather than terminating the session.
- Fixed React TUI exit leaving the shell prompt concatenated with the last TUI line. The terminal cleanup handler now writes a trailing newline (`\n`) alongside the cursor-show escape sequence so the shell prompt always starts on a fresh line.

### Changed

- React TUI now groups consecutive `tool` + `tool_result` transcript rows into a single compound row: success shows the result line count inline (e.g. `→ 24L`), errors show a red icon and up to 5 lines of error detail beneath the tool row. Standalone successful tool results are suppressed to reduce transcript noise; standalone errors are still surfaced.
- README now links to contribution docs, changelog, showcase material, and provider compatibility guidance.
- README quick start now includes a one-command demo and clearer provider compatibility notes.
- README provider compatibility section updated to include OpenAI-format providers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01
