# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenHarness should be recorded in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project currently tracks changes in a lightweight, repository-oriented way.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `diagnose` skill: trace agent run failures and regressions using structured evidence from run artifacts.
- OpenAI-compatible API client (`--api-format openai`) supporting any provider that implements the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format, including Alibaba DashScope, DeepSeek, GitHub Models, Groq, Together AI, Ollama, and more.
- `OPENHARNESS_API_FORMAT` environment variable for selecting the API format.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` fallback when using OpenAI-format providers.
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for Python linting, tests, and frontend TypeScript checks.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with local setup, validation commands, and PR expectations.
- `docs/SHOWCASE.md` with concrete OpenHarness usage patterns and demo commands.
- GitHub issue templates and a pull request template.
- Built-in `codex` output style for compact, low-noise transcript rendering in React TUI.

### Fixed

- `BackendHostConfig` was missing the `cwd` field, causing `AttributeError: 'BackendHostConfig' object has no attribute 'cwd'` on startup when `oh` was run after the runtime refactor that added `cwd` support to `build_runtime`.
- Shell-escape `$ARGUMENTS` substitution in command hooks to prevent shell injection from payload values containing metacharacters like `$(...)` or backticks.
- Swarm `_READ_ONLY_TOOLS` now uses actual registered tool names (snake_case) instead of PascalCase, fixing read-only auto-approval in `handle_permission_request`.
- Memory scanner now parses YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `type`) instead of returning raw `---` as description.
- Memory search matches against body content in addition to metadata, with metadata weighted higher for relevance.
- Memory search tokenizer handles Han characters for multilingual queries.
- Fixed duplicate response in React TUI caused by double Enter key submission in the input handler.
- Fixed concurrent permission modals overwriting each other in TUI default mode when the LLM returns multiple tool calls in one response; `_ask_permission` now serialises callers via an `asyncio.Lock` so each modal is shown and resolved before the next one is emitted.
- Reduced React TUI redraw pressure when `output_style=codex` by avoiding token-level assistant buffer flushes during streaming.

### Changed

- README now links to contribution docs, changelog, showcase material, and provider compatibility guidance.
- README quick start now includes a one-command demo and clearer provider compatibility notes.
- README provider compatibility section updated to include OpenAI-format providers.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Initial public release of OpenHarness.
- Core agent loop, tool registry, permission system, hooks, skills, plugins, MCP support, and terminal UI.
